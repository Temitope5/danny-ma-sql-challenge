4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
