This project will solve and document the responses to Danny Ma's SQL case studies. The case studies cover different real-life business data challenges that can help you hone your skills and better build your portfolio.

The project is sponsored by Resagratia. We also have a community on WhatsApp for all things data. Feel free to join - https://chat.whatsapp.com/H13DoPOFz8s06AaJxJP6YW

To follow along the SQL challenges, the database and code editor for the case studies can be found here:
